# PDF_Reader

I have developed this code so that it can read your PDF file. 

One must give the input of the PDF file by specifying the path of the file in this format 
Eg : C:\\Users\\Lydia\\Downloads\\Python.pdf  

After this, you can set the speed of the voice by setting a value. 
100 is a good speed to start with.

After this you can give the page from which you want the program to read from. 
And you can also specify the ending page number for the same. 

Hoping to develop this to a greater extent in the future !!!
